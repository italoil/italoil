We handpick our olives during the day and cold-press them the same evening to preserve their exceptional quality, minimal acidity, and fresh flavor.</p><p>Our groves have never been treated with pesticides or chemicals, ensuring a natural and healthy product. From production to importation and direct sale, we handle every step without intermediaries, taking 100% responsibility for quality and consistency.</p>",
